# Portal-JS

### REQIRES KUBEJS AND POWERFULJS
A KubeJS powered custom portal that I spent around two whole weeks making.

Almost everthing that is in here will work out of the box*, just follow the license if you intend on using it.

This script originates from my modpack ToasTech available on CurseForge. It's bad, don't play it.

*When making a recipe for the wormhole item or `/give`ing it to yourself, give it an NBT with the key `"temp"`. ex: `{temp: "something really stupid"}`. This will make it usable for the portals.
